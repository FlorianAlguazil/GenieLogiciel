	<abstract>Abstract When humans produce summaries of documents, they do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them. Rather, they create new sentences that are grammati- cal, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original doc- ument. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a sim- pler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most impor- tant pieces of information. These two goals can con- ﬂict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-tree approaches to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline. </abstract>
